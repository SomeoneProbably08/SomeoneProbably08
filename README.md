## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am SomeoneProbably, and i am a game design student in the UK. I mainly work in unreal, and am still learning the basic ideas and concepts of the subject as a whole. I want to use this to explore it more.

Currently this will be used as an outlet to be more free than the course allows me to be.

my pronouns are He/They and i am looking for any and all feedback which you may have.
